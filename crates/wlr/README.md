# wlr

Safe bindings to [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots),
built on [`wlr-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/wlr-sys).

`wlr`'s minor version tracks the wlroots minor it binds, so pick the one
matching your system:

| `wlr` | wlroots | Packaged by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0.20` | 0.20 | Arch | published |
| `0.19` | 0.19 | Ubuntu 26.04 | planned |
| `0.17` | 0.17 | Ubuntu 24.04 | planned |
| `0.15` | 0.15 | Ubuntu 22.04 | planned |

```toml
wlr = "0.20"
```

Only `0.20` exists today. The older lines are named here because
[`wlr-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/wlr-sys) already binds them and `wlr`
follows on the same branches, not because they are on crates.io yet.

The API is held identical across all four, so once they ship, moving between
them is a version change rather than a code change.

## 0.20.1

Event sources and the scene graph.

- `Runtime` — the long-lived handle a compositor keeps: fd sources, the scene
  graph, the output layout, the renderer, and every by-id operation.
- `Interest`, `Readiness`, `SourceId`, `FdHandler` — file-descriptor sources,
  registered by each `run_all` and re-armed by the next one.
- `LoopHandler`, `Until`, `Backend::run_all` — a blocking entry point that
  stops when the consumer says so, and flushes clients every turn.
- `ToplevelHandler` and `SeatHandler` are declared here with no methods, so
  that `Handlers`' supertrait list is fixed from the first release; their
  methods arrive in 0.20.2 and 0.20.3 and are additive.
- `RectId` and the `Runtime::*_rect` family — solid-colour scene nodes.
- `Output::size`, `Output::schedule_frame`,
  `Output::enable_with_preferred_mode`, `Display::add_socket_auto`,
  `Display::flush_clients`.

`Backend::run` is unchanged and stays forever as the output-only path.
